Hello?

[Elle]
This is Elle, Dr. Montague's assistant.

[Elle]
Montague took every precaution before the experiment but...

[Elle]
He still went bonkers!

[Elle]
Everyone did their best to help him though! We all look up to him, after all.

[Elle]
They managed to hold him down. In the spur of the moment, they jammed in him into the Proton Suit.

[Elle]
It's got this neat feature where they can lock it up so he can't move!

[Elle]
Don't worry too much, he's doing fine now!

[Elle]
Well...

[Elle]
He's been saying some creepy things when I talk to him.

[Elle]
"Get out of my head", for instance.

[Elle]
I'm sure it's just a phase. The science guys think they can fix his brain up!
