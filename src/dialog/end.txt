[Elle]
It's you...

[Scientist]
Project Proton... you're awake?

[PROTON]
I need to get to my lift.

[Scientist]
...It's right over there at the end of the room.

[Elle]
There isn't enough power...

[PROTON]
What?

[Elle]
Since the power was cut, we've been running off the auxilary but...

[Scientist]
It's ran out. There isn't enough for both our lift and yours to run.

[Elle]
We were waiting for Specks to come back, he said he would!

[PROTON]
He's dead.

[Elle]
You can't mean...

[Scientist]
Proton, you're priority. You need to get out of here and to the surface.

[PROTON]
That was my plan.

[Elle]
But...

[PROTON]
I'll be taking my leave now.
