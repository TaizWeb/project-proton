Why, hello there.

[PROTON]
Who are you?

[???]
I'm called... Zero.

[Zero]
You see, I'm looking forward to meeting someone.

[Zero]
And I believe that someone is right beyond that door.

[Zero]
So if you could just be so kind as to step aside...

[PROTON]
No.

[Zero]
What was that, my blue friend?

[PROTON]
You're not getting past me.

[Zero]
I see.
