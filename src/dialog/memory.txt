[Elle]
Why are you guys making this anyway?

[Montague]
Because we were asked to.

[Elle]
But don't you guys make things to help people?

[Elle]
You made an arm for that one guy for free!

[Montague]
This can help people too, you know.

[Elle]
But isn't Proton a weapon?

[Montague]
It is, yes. But it'll be used by a good person someday.

[Montague]
He will help people with it.

[Elle]
Are you sure?

[Montague]
Of course, that's what being human is all about, you know.

[Elle]
Yeah! That's right!

[Montague]
Your hair's all messy again, Elle. You look like a pink mop.

[Elle]
Hey!
