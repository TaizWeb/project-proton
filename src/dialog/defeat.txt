Augh...

[PROTON]
Are you done?

[Zero]
Damn you. That damned blood...

[Zero]
She's here, isn't she? She's the only one...

[PROTON]
I have no idea what you're talking about.

[Zero]
Are you... Project Proton?

[PROTON]
No.

[PROTON]
I'm someone a lot better than that.

[Zero]
Heh. You don't remember, do you? I've seen it before.

[Zero]
You don't know anything, do you? About us?

[Zero]
Figures the Government wouldn't tell you what's really going on here.

[PROTON]
Then tell me.

[Zero]
And what's the point in telling a dead man?

[Zero]
My backup has arrived, I was just buying some time.

[Zero]
Goodbye, my blue friend.
