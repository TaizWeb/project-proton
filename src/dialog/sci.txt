[Proton]
Who are you?

[Specks]
Oh my god, you must be...

[Proton]
Project Proton.

[Specks]
Oh... Right. Have you noticed those doors yet? They don't unlock.

[Proton]
I've noticed.

[Specks]
The lab is locking itself down to prevent those monsters from getting deeper.
This passageway here leads back to the main bunker. I plan to go in there and unlock the doors.
The problem is, if I do that, the monsters will undoubtedly get to the others.

[Proton]
Others?

[Specks]
There's a group of survivors not too far from here and a lift to get them underground to safety.

[Proton]
So you don't want to risk them getting hurt?

[Specks]
Exactly. So I came up with a solution. I'm going to blow up the lab and the cave sections when I activate the doors. That should prevent the advancing army of monsters from getting to them, and it should buy you some time.

[Specks]
The thing is... I get blown up too.

[Proton]
That's stupid.

[Specks]
Excuse me?

[Proton]
Your goal should be for yourself to survive. Anything else is foolish.

[Specks]
...You don't feel much anymore, do you, "Proton"?

[Proton]
...

[Specks]
Do you even remember who you are? The kind of person you used to be?

[Proton]
...

[Specks]
Maybe you think what I'm doing is stupid. But other's would say what I'm doing is being a hero.

[Specks]
But me? I don't say any of that. I call it being human. Simple as that.

[Proton]
Being human...

[Specks]
Well, I'm going to go ahead and do my part. It shouldn't take me long, so you should get going.

[Specks]
And Proton?

[Proton]
Yes?

[Specks]
Maybe you should try being human again someday.
