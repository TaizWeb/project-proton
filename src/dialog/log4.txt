The lab boys are losing their minds over the girl.

[Montague]
She's dead by all rights: no pulse, brain activity, and pale as a ghost. However she's still giving off life signs in other ways.

[Montague]
It's like her cells haven't figured out she's dead yet. The blood we've tested on is showing the same results.

[Montague]
The Government is getting uneasy about our findings, and now they're threatening to cut our funding unless we start posting some progress.

[Montague]
The lab boys wanted to see how these cells would react in a living host, so we've gotten some of our subjects to submit for it. After the experiment... they started undergoing mass psychosis.

[Montague]
They'd tear at their restraints while screaming like a bunch of animals. When they broke their restraints...

[Montague]
They tore their own throats out. 

[Montague]
There was nothing we could do but watch.

[Montague]
The other volunteers were watching too. Nobody wants to test anymore, and neither do we. We're abandoning the experiments.

[Montague]
I'm glad.
