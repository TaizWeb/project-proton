Progress on Project Proton has been steady. As head of the project, I take personal pride in my team's efforts.

Not all of them have their hearts set on Proton however, some have their sights set on those new creatures popping up on our shores. They seem to believe the government knows more than we do. The government has prompted us to instead turn Proton into a weapon against them.

Through some of my own negotiations, I've managed to get them to hand over some classified documents. It was almost too easy though, as if they wanted us to have them. I hear that things are getting bad in containing the creatures, so maybe they're placing more hope than I think in Proton.

[Montague]
My team pored over the documents, a few decades ago there were similar sightings of these abnormal creatures around some sort of mansion. An army was deployed on the scene, yet no communication was heard of them within a week of their supposed arrival.

A few months later, the mansion completely collapsed. Nobody was found in the wreckage aside from some empty meal packaging and cigarettes. Perhaps a soldier was responsible? They suspect the entire thing was concocted by a long-dead cult, though I'll have to cross-reference other documents.
