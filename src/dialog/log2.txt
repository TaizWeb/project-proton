Progress on Project Proton has been steady.

[Montague]
As head of the project, I take personal pride in my team's efforts.

[Montague]
Not all of them have their hearts set on Proton however, some have their sights set on those new creatures popping up on our shores.

[Montague]
They seem to believe the government knows more than we do.

[Montague]
The government has prompted us to instead turn Proton into a weapon against them.

[Montague]
Through some of my own negotiations, I've managed to get them to hand over some classified documents.

[Montague]
It was almost too easy though, as if they wanted us to have them.

[Montague]
I hear that things are getting bad in containing the creatures, so maybe they're placing more hope than I think in Proton.

[Montague]
My team pored over the documents, a few decades ago there were similar sightings of these abnormal creatures around some sort of mansion.

[Montague]
An army was deployed on the scene, yet no communication was heard of them within a week of their supposed arrival.

[Montague]
A few months later, the mansion completely collapsed.

[Montague]
Nobody was found in the wreckage aside from some empty meal packaging and cigarettes.

[Montague]
Perhaps a soldier was responsible? They suspect the entire thing was concocted by a long-dead cult.

[Montague]
I'll have to cross-reference other documents.
