Dr. Montague isn't responding anymore.

[Specks]
Many of the team believe him to be a lost cause.

[Specks]
Since our power has been cut, a number of the crew want to cut his lift support.

[Specks]
I won't let them.

[Specks]
To make matters worse, all our ground support has been eliminated. The enemy has breached our walls and began invading.

[Specks]
In response, most of our own crew has escaped the facility.

[Specks]
I know I should take Elle and run but...

[Specks]
I can't leave Montague.

[Specks]
I'll do everything I can to wake him up again and get him out of here.

[Specks]
I swear it.
