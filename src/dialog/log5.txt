Bad news.

[Montague]
The government wants us to keep testing.

[Montague]
We tried to refuse, but they have men just above the lab. They said they'll "do what needs to be done" if we resist.

[Montague]
I'm not going to let anyone die. Not anymore.

[Montague]
I ordered them to perform the next experiment on me. I don't care what happens.

[Montague]
If I end up tearing myself apart like the others... I accept.

[Montague]
If this is my last message... Then you know what happened to me.

[Montague]
I'm sorry, Elle.

[PROTON]
...Elle?
