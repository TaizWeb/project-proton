Hiya, Elle again!

[Elle]
Bad news.

[Elle]
All of Dr. Montague's science buddies are losing their minds...

[Elle]
They're all mad at each other, one of the specimens was stolen.

[Elle]
I think it was that girl they brought in the other day, the one that was all cut up.

[Elle]
I'm sure Dr. Montague will fix everything when he wakes up again...

[Elle]
He always does!
