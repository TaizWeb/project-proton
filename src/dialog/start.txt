[Gray]
I've managed to escape.

[Gray]
Through some sheer luck I've managed to find a room that still had power going, but I see now that it's only because it houses PROTON.

[Gray]
I've sealed the room off, so I should be safe in here. But... I'm bleeding really badly. One of those things managed to slice me right open. 

[Gray]
I can't move much, so I'm typing a final message. A message for you, PROTON. If I've done this right, you should wake up in a few days.

[Gray]
...I'll be gone by then, either by blood loss or starvation.

[Gray]
It's a shame, I wanted to tell you everything in person, but I suppose this will have to do. 

[Gray]
I can't go into details, but this entire facility has been locked down tight, nothing in, nothing out.

[Gray]
However, there is an escape pod, one we created for you in case something like this happened. I'm sure you can find it.

[Gray]
After reading this message, the door should unlock, and the power from your life support pod should reroute to the facility.

[Gray]
Work fast, I'm not sure how much is left. Good luck, PROTON.

[PROTON]
...
