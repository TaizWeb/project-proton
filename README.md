## Engine
Project Proton was created using [Heartbeat](https://github.com/taizweb/heartbeat), a simple platformer engine, which is built on the love2d libraries.

## Installation
You can grab it right on [itch.io](https://taiz.itch.io/project-proton) or you can refer to the [releases](https://github.com/TaizWeb/project-proton/releases) tab to get the game. If using Windows or MacOS, you do not need to manually install the dependencies. Alternatively, you can clone the repository and run love on the `src` folder directly.
